# üê£ Mini GCP (Local Data Pipeline)

This project simulates a **modern data pipeline** architecture, entirely **locally** and **without requiring Google Cloud or paid services**. It follows a modular design to extract, transform, load, validate, and analyze synthetic sales data using Python, Apache Beam, DuckDB, and PostgreSQL (optional).
