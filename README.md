# 🐣 Mini GCP (Local Data Pipeline)

This project simulates a **modern data pipeline** architecture, entirely **locally**. It follows a modular design to extract, transform, load, validate, and analyze synthetic sales data using Python, Apache Beam, DuckDB, and PostgreSQL.

---

## 🧠 Why "Mini GCP"?

This repo mimics a GCP-like modular pipeline (with stages like Cloud Functions, Dataflow, BigQuery), but:

- 🆓 Works locally

- 🧪 Ideal for testing and learning

- 💸 No cloud cost involved

---

## ⚡ Quickstart

- Clone the repository and set up the environment:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/mini-gcp.git
cd mini-gcp
```

---

## 🔄 Pipeline Flow

```
raw data → extract → initial_validation → transform → load → final_validation → warehouse
```

## 📊 Data Folder Overview

- **data/raw/:** Initial synthetic data (e.g., raw_sales_1.csv)

- **data/extract/:** Copied file ready for transformation

- **data/initial_validation/:** validation raw reports in .csv and .json

- **data/processed/:** Cleaned file after transformation

- **data/validation/:** Schema reports in .csv and .json

- **data/warehouse/:** Final data stored in DuckDB (sales.duckdb)

### 🐍 Creating a Python Virtual Environment in VS Code

To keep dependencies isolated and avoid conflicts, it’s a good practice to use a virtual environment for this project. Here’s how you can set it up in VS Code:

1. Open your project folder in VS Code.
2. Open the integrated terminal (Ctrl + ) or via menu: Terminal > New Terminal.
3. Create a virtual environment (only once):

- On Linux/macOS:

```
python3 -m venv .venv
```

- On Windows (PowerShell):

```
python -m venv .venv
```

- This creates a .venv folder inside your project with an isolated Python environment.

4. Activate the virtual environment:

- On Linux/macOS:

```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

- On Windows (PowerShell):

```
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

- After activation, your terminal prompt will show the environment name, e.g., (.venv).

5. Install project dependencies inside the virtual environment:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

6. (Optional) Select the interpreter in VS Code:

- Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` (or `Cmd + Shift + P` on macOS)

- Type and select Python: Select Interpreter

- Choose the interpreter from your `.venv` folder (it will show something like `.venv/bin/python` or `.venv\Scripts\python.exe`)

Now VS Code will use the virtual environment’s Python for running and debugging.

### ⚙️ Project Setup & Maintenance Scripts

This project includes a set of helper scripts to simplify initial setup, resetting the environment, and fixing file permissions when working with Airflow and Docker locally.

1. `1_init.sh` — Initialize Airflow
This script builds the Airflow images and runs the Airflow initialization process inside Docker.

Usage:

```
chmod +x 1_init.sh
./1_init.sh
```

What it does:

- Builds the `airflow-init` image without using Docker BuildKit (for better compatibility).

- Runs the `airflow-init` container to set up Airflow’s metadata database and initial configuration.

2. `2_fix_permissions.sh` — Fix Project Folder Permissions
This script adjusts file and folder permissions so that the Airflow user inside the container (UID `50000`) can access and modify project files without permission errors.

Usage:

```
chmod +x 2_fix_permissions.sh
./2_fix_permissions.sh
```

What it does:

- Iterates over key project folders (`dags`, `data`, `extract`, `transform`, etc.).

- Changes the owner to UID `50000` (Airflow user) and GID `0` (root group).

Sets secure folder (`755`) and file (`644`) permissions.

Use this when:

- You see permission denied errors when Airflow tries to read/write files.

3. `3_reset_docker.sh` — Reset Docker Environment
This script completely cleans and rebuilds your local Docker setup for the project.

Usage:

```
chmod +x 3_reset_docker.sh
./3_reset_docker.sh
```

What it does:

- Stops all running containers and removes volumes/orphan containers.

- Prunes unused volumes and containers.

- Rebuilds the project’s Docker image from scratch.

- Starts services again with `docker compose up -d`.

Use this when:

- You want a fresh start.

- There are issues with containers not working as expected.

#### 💡 Tip:
If you’re setting up the project for the first time, run the scripts in this order:

1. `1_init.sh` → Initialize Airflow.

2. `2_fix_permissions.sh` → Ensure correct file permissions.

3. (Optional) `3_reset_docker.sh` if you need a clean rebuild later.
